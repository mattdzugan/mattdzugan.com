## Work Experience
#### The Boeing Company  
Satellite Development Center  
_El Segundo, California_   
2012 to Present  
2017 World-Class Engineer Award Recipient

**Senior Communications Systems Modeling-and-Simulation Architect**  
Identified key system-level design decisions & modeled their outcomes & impacts for 3 unique satellite systems
- Traded several vastly different architecture solutions by building detailed computational models of the systems, evaluating performance using many standard and custom metrics, and estimating impacts to both  capital and operating expenditures
- Invented industry-leading (patents pending) solutions to:
 - weather dependent power pooling in direct-radiating-array antennas
 - streaming operations for space-based video-on-demand services
 - optimal geographic siting of nodes in constrained and dynamic-connectivity networks,
 - minimum angular area definition while maintaining full volumetric coverage
- Created now-standard software tools and models for network throughput optimization/calculation, 3-dimensional multipath & reflection analysis, system performance and geospatial data visualization
- Regularly communicated analysis results to internal and external audiences, executive and technical, most notably to the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) which involved communicating the results of over 4 TB of data to a largely non-engineering audience  

**Senior New Business Campaign Team-Lead: End-to-End Communications-System Architecture**  
Led the End-to-End team on multiple design bids resulting in winning over $1B in new satellite contracts
- Communicated data with external customers, and professionally challenged their assumptions allowing the internal Boeing team to pursue design options that were ultimately critical to our contract awards
- Iterated  through multiple design iterations, tasking the internal team with actionable exploratory analyses, and creating several key performance metrics to engage the potential customer and mature the design

**Digital Signal Processing Algorithms Designer**  
Designed and tested error-detection/correction algorithms and circuits used on 4 spacecraft currently on orbit
- Designed several error-detection/correction algorithms using MATLAB & Simulink and identified pros and cons of each to enable final selection for flight hardware
- Implemented my design in VHDL and developed a suite of 100+ test waveforms, and executed them via Hardware-in-the-Loop tests to ensure the intended functionality
